# mkcert - Generate self-signed certificates
This project got inspired by https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert and in some ways it's very similar but for me it was not enough so I decided to implement my own version

# What it can do
```
Generate a CA Certificate with custom parameters
Generate a Certificate from a new or imported CA with custom parameters
Generate a CSR
Auto-regenerate certificates near their expiration date and execute commands on success with a post-hook
```
